# todo-crud

This is a simple CRUD application that allows you to manage your tasks. I am mostly making this to try out a new stack using some technologies that have caught my eye. I've been wanting to try and get away from Node.js and Next.js since they use up a lot of memory and I want to keep my applications lean as to not overspend on server resources. To assist me in this goal, I am also using Go for the programming language of my backend for this project.

Hopefully, this results in an efficient end product, and I'll learn some new tricks along the way. It's nice to break out of my comfort zone.

## Technologies

### HTMX

HTMX is what I will be using in place of React for this project. It allows for dynamic control over the html of the site which is all I really need for this project. It seems like a good simple alternative.

### Go

Go is what I am really excited for. It brings me back to my roots as a C programmer. Compiled languages have a lot of benefits and I am excited to see how Go can help me spend less on server resource costs. It also reminds me of when I used to use Python's Flask for backend development. I feel that Flask was very nice for quick and simple APIs and I am hoping Go can bring back some of that magic.

### Postgres

Usually only use SQLite, MongoDB, or Firebase for my projects. I want to try out Postgres for this project to see how it compares to the other databases I have used. I have heard good things about it and I am excited to see how it performs.
